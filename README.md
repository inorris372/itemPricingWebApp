# itemPricingWebApp

##### This App is a service that users may implement to track the pricing of particular items found on various online
##### retail web stores until the price of the particular item they are interested in drops beneath a certain limit -
##### which is set by the user.  Users may register and login to individual accounts, and may add/remove stores in
##### addition to editing store configurations and items that they are tracking.  Updates are sent to the user via the
##### email which they have used to register for an account.

##### I want to also give credit to whom credit is due, and would like to mention Jose at School of Code's Python WebApp course
##### found at Udemy.com.  This tutorial was perhaps the best tutorial I have found online that presents in a very logical and 
##### consistent fashion how to develop a web app, and to be able to code alongside Jose virtually in order to develop this app 
##### was a great help to my improvement in understanding of best practices that must be implemented by software developers in
##### this day and age!  If you would like to develop a solid understanding of Python, then his courses are a worthwhile 
##### investment!

##### This web app will be host shortly at the URL below.  You are free to sign up and give it a try!
